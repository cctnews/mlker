	43、没有你，就没了世界。你是我的世界，我的宇宙，我的所有。
　　有功夫，哑忍和玉成也是一种爱，哪怕是玉成薄弱与低微。有功夫，十足都不会称愿，遗失的不会再回顾。摊开手也是一种爱，一种哑忍的爱。既是爱，何必对立相互，最大的爱是只有他（她）痛快，即使两部分在一道，不过为了相互妨害，那么如许的爱仍旧停止与玉成吧！并不是一切的爱城市有一个优美的究竟，爱一部分也偶然确定会在一道，从来天瘠土老。
	那天，半子用车送我回了一趟故乡，偶遇已是古稀之年的姑夫。传闻他正在进修考驾驶执照。
39, once I've always thought, really treat a person you love can forever, remember now, it's just a joke.
Lanes YouChang YouChang, coming from the depths of the time, again to the depths of the years.
Time of solidification in the lanes of each piece of blue bricks on the tile, the lintel carved on that the wind and rain erosion, in that all have clean on slippery, bluestone or pebble, look at those old wall covered with moss, look at those loose slump horsehead walls, the reeds on the wall already from how many times, was still burning.
Look at those and young children, once upon a time, the head is silver, step back hunch your Jian, time flows rapidly from the alleys, wind, can't stop walking in the footsteps of it.
Page picture beside a flash, fresh or old porch, wall tile, the fence, or mountain, the solution opens window or under dark brown stone carve patterns or designs on woodwork, occasionally a now one corner of the green trees or ephemeral contacts of the shadow of a bird, noise from each gap in the crowded out and fill the wind together, then drifted away.
I imagine those hidden in the thick wall of some details, time has not yet been covered some of the copper is still shining in brick joints, as well as those in the wall of the time's dust, there are some twists and turns of the story continues or oblivion?
Village of rings on the wall of the lanes clearly visible, under the thick moss, on each piece of slab or blue bricks.
From lanes of the head looked down at the other end, there will be some do not belong to the shadow flash across time: the peddler carrying a heavy basket at bear wobbly came along, a dog is chasing the other dogs, barking sound broken the tranquility of the inherent in the alleys, or a cow walking slowly, followed a grass stem urchin in mouth...
Lanes piecemeal patched up the sky in the quiet, the sunlight from each place of the open door, want to illuminate lanes every detail.
Want to read a page of the village, and then go to a walk in the alleys.
From lanes of entrance into, literally where to a halt, knocking on a door, will do, and even those not details, illuminated by the sun will be in front of you.
Village this one book thread-bound book, all dressed in the alleys, one hundred years ago, or more years later, although different is the line ever new, and the page has turned yellow.
